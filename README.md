###    The goal of this project at present:
  * take information on a jFrame and add functionality so that whitespace becomes transparent, alpha value 0, and clickthroughable.
    clickthroughable - to the desktop, to another window, or to another running transparent app that has a portion with alpha value > 0. 
   
###  This original upload came a stack overflow question 
  * Who wanted a picture of dog with all else (white stuff) transparent. 
  * I want everything in the jpanel whole (alpha value > 0) except for white spaces(alpha value == 0) are which will be transparent.
  * I could create an engine like a game engine that would add the parts to the transparent.
   
### -Independent Project - (Seperate Thread)
  * take the transparent box and create shortcut keys
  * that turn transparency on and off.
  * 3 phases... 
  * (1)hard as in normal.. 
  * (2)transparent and click throughable.. 
  * (3)see throughable but not clickthroughable..
